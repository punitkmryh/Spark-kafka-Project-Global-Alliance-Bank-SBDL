### If you're still facing issues with pushing to GitHub after updating the remote URL with a personal access token, here are a few additional steps you can take:

1. **Check Authentication:**
   Double-check that the personal access token is correctly set in the remote URL. Ensure that there are no typos or extra characters.

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   The URL should look like:

   ```
   https://USERNAME:TOKEN@github.com/punitkmryh/Spark-kafka-Project-Global-Alliance-Bank-SBDL.git
   ```

2. **SSH Authentication (Optional):**
   If you prefer to use SSH for authentication, you can set up an SSH key on your machine and add it to your GitHub account. GitHub provides instructions on [generating an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [adding the SSH key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

   After setting up SSH, you can update the remote URL to use SSH:

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:punitkmryh/Spark-kafka-Project-Global-Alliance-Bank-SBDL.git
   ```

3. **Check Repository Existence:**
   Ensure that the repository "Spark-kafka-Project-Global-Alliance-Bank-SBDL" exists on GitHub and that you have the correct permissions to push.

4. **Retry Push:**
   After making sure everything is set up correctly, try the push command again:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

5. **Debugging:**
   If the issue persists, you can try running the push command with debugging information to get more details:

   ```bash
   GIT_TRACE=1 git push -u origin master
   ```

   This will print detailed information about the push process and may help identify the problem.

### If you want to push your local files to a remote repository, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Git (if not done already):**
   If your project is not already a Git repository, you need to initialize it.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Files to Staging:**
   Add the files you want to push to the staging area.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   The dot (`.`) adds all files in the current directory. If you want to add specific files, replace the dot with the file names.

3. **Commit Changes:**
   Commit the changes with a commit message.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

4. **Add Remote Repository:**
   If the remote repository is not added, add it using the following command. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your remote repository.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```

5. **Push to Remote Repository:**
   Push the changes to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   Replace "master" with the name of your branch if it's different.

   If it's the first push, you may need to use the `-u` option to set the upstream branch.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   After the initial setup, subsequent pushes can be done with `git push`.

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

Remember to replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your remote repository. If you haven't committed your changes or added remote repository, do those steps before pushing.
